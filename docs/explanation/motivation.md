# Motivation

## The Problem I Actually Have

I'm not a huge fan of TypeScript or modern frontend frameworks. Partly it's a skill gapâ€”I haven't invested the time to learn them deeply. But also, I don't want to.

I want to ship features. I want polished UIs. I don't want an entire extra layer in my stack.

After years in regulated environments where every dependency update triggers compliance reviews, I've developed strong opinions about dependencies. Specifically: fewer is better.

## HTMX Changed Things

**[HTMX](http://htmx.org/)** showed me you don't need a frontend framework to build dynamic interfaces.

HTML is actually a pretty good interface. Browsers are good at rendering it. The problem was never HTML. The problem was the lack of interactivity without JavaScript frameworks.

HTMX solved this by extending HTML with attributes. Want to fetch data? `hx-get="/data"`. Want to update part of the page? `hx-target="#result"`.

## The Missing Piece

HTMX handles the browser side. But server-side, I was still writing boilerplate:

```go
func handleGetArticle(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    id := r.PathValue("id")
    article, err := getArticle(r.Context(), id)
    if err != nil {
        http.Error(w, err.Error(), 500)
        return
    }
    tmpl.ExecuteTemplate(w, "article.html", article)
}
```

Multiply this by 50 routes and you're drowning in nearly identical functions.

**sqlc** showed me the pattern: declare what you want (SQL queries), generate the boring (easy to read) Go code. SQLC-generated Go code is quite readable.

Why not the same for HTTP handlers? Declare what you want (routes in templates), generate the boring code (handlers).

## Why Not Just Use Reflection?

[Initially `muxt` was written as a function to generate reflection-based handlers](https://github.com/typelate/muxt/blob/33f2eb69d84d6bf2c2ad87c5ddfee9fb2e0fea31/handler.go).

Then I tried to debug it.

[Reflection is never clear](https://youtu.be/PAAkCSZUG1c?si=gT_ga16SMOKNshqp&t=922). You can step through it, but you still need to consider the runtime oddities (yes Go has those) and (dare I say) performance.
You can't easily see what's happening. When it breaks, good luck figuring out why.

Code generation produces code you can read. Code you can debug. Code you can modify if you *need* to.

Go proverb: "Clear is better than clever."

## Why Not Just Use LLMs?

I've experimented with LLM prompts to generate handler boilerplate. It works for one-off generation.

But it doesn't scale across a team. Everyone has their own prompts. 
Everyone generates slightly different code.
There's no shared contract.
Claude Code is great (I started using it around `v0.18.0-dev.2` while creating `muxt`);
however, in code reviews in my team, I noticed differences in how we interact with the agent.
Preferences about what we put in our "allow" or "ask" claude settings can lead to very different iteration cycles and output.
How do you keep 50 handlers consistent when they were all generated separately by ChatGPT?
A tool to standardize an important interface in a piece of software is not a bad idea.

Code generation from templates gives you consistency. Improve the generator, regenerate everything, done.

## The Joy of Boring Code

I **love** writing Go. It's a straightforward language that compiles to a single binary.

Minimal developer facing runtime complexity. No package manager that downloads the internet. Just a binary that runs.

Muxt generates boring Go code. No framework. No magic. Just functions that match templates to HTTP routes.

This lets me focus on the interesting parts: the domain logic, the user experience, the actual problem I'm solving.

## The Stack That Works

My current stack (in prod):
- **Go** for the server
- **HTMX** for interactivity
- **html/template** for rendering

Locally I have these tools installed in most projects:
- **sqlc** for database queries
- **muxt** for routing
- **counterfeiter** for test double generation

This stack fits in my head. Each piece maps to steps in implementing a CRUD app. The pieces compose cleanly.

I can hand this to a junior Go developer, and they'll understand it quickly. Try that with Node, Typescript, Next.js + React + Prisma + tRPC/Protobuf + Zod + ...

## Time to Touch Grass

I use `muxt` because it lets me write and understand code quickly, which means I spend less time debugging framework magic and more time building features.

Or eating wild blackberries.
